SaasKit is a .NET toolkit for building SaaS (Software As A Service) applications.

The goal of the project is to help developers build SaaS products without getting in the way. It aims to be platform agnostic and as simple to use as possible.

#### Getting Started

[ASP.NET MVC 5 / Web API 2](https://github.com/saaskit/saaskit/wiki/SaasKit-Multitenancy)  
[ASP.NET Core](http://benfoster.io/blog/tagged/saaskit)

This project is open source and I do my best to support it in my spare time. If you'd like to discuss commercial support options or need help implementing multi-tenancy or building SAAS applications in .NET then [get in touch](mailto:info@saaskit.net).
